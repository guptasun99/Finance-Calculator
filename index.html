                        <h3>📈 Compound Interest - The 8th Wonder</h3>
                        <p>Albert Einstein allegedly called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." It's the interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Starting early allows your investments to grow exponentially over time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h3>💵 Simple vs Compound Interest</h3>
                        <p>Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, making it straightforward but less profitable. Compound interest earns interest on interest, making it more powerful for long-term wealth building.</p>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h3>📊 Understanding CAGR</h3>
                        <p>CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is the mean annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period. It's useful for comparing the growth rates of different investments or portfolios.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h3>🎯 The Power of Starting Early</h3>
                        <p>A 25-year-old investing $200/month at 7% return will have ~$525,000 by age 65. A 35-year-old doing the same will have only ~$244,000. Starting 10 years earlier more than doubles your wealth!</p>

                        <p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate) to reduce risk. A well-diversified portfolio can weather market volatility better.</p>
